       By default if two branches are seen by the git-plugin; <i>feature</i>, and <i>master</i>, where feature points to a commit that is an <b>ancestor</b> of master 
       then only master will be built. This option prevents feature from being filtered. This functionality is desired when teams are working on
       a branch that is contained within another branch, and would like their commits built regardless.

       With Filtering:                               Without Filtering:
       o <-- master (buildable)                      o <-- master (buildable)
       |\                                            |\
       | o <-- feature (filtered)                    | o <-- feature (buildable)
       |/                                            |/
       o                                             o
