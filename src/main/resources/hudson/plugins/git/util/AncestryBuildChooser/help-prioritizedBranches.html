<div>
  Prioritized branches use substring to match repository branches. This can be useful if branch names containing 'CRITICAL' need to jump ahead of other user builds.
  <p/>
  <pre>This example illustrates the build order when CRITICAL and RELEASE are specified:
	Commit order:
		feature/my-other-feature
		user/CRITICAL/my-critical-feature
		RELEASE/0.0.1
	Build order:
		user/CRITICAL/my-critical-feature
		RELEASE/0.0.1
		feature/my-other-feature
  </pre>
  Multiple branch priority names must be separated by a new line, and leaving the textbox empty means no branch priority sorting is done.
